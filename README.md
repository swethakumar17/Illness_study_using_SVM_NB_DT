# Illness_study_using_SVM_NB_DT

The dataset used is ‘illnessstudy.csv’ and would be performing three algorithms on the dataset. They are, 
SVM
Naïve Bayes
Decision Tree
In the end, we'll determine the best model among the three for ‘illnessstudy’ dataset. 

The dataset ‘illnessstudy’ has 30 variables which are the measurements of tumors, and they help in identification of tumor. 
These 30 attributes are our independent variables.
The dependent or target variable is ‘diagnosis’ which has two values:
‘M’ for Malignant, meaning the tumor is harmful and cancerous.
‘B’ for Benign, meaning the tumor is harmless.
